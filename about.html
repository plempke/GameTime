  <h2> Journey Into Web Development </h2>

  
  
  <div class = "infoColumn">
      This is some information about my Site and how I went about coding everything.
      I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a>  as a resource as well as various other css/html/js documentation
      guides. A large portion of my development was guessing and checking my way through
      the formatting of my website. As painstaking of a process that it is, in order to 
      understand how all of the elements play off of eachother it's imperative to mess
      around with each element until you develop a firm understanding of what it does. A great starting point for me
      came from a basic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JluqTojuME&t=763s">Youtube video</a> on webdevelopment in accompaniment with the W3School site I mentioned previously. <br><br>
      The most difficult challenge for formatting the site was taking the games that I had 
      written in Javascript and implementing them onto my website. It took a fair amount of
      time to manipulate the elements in html/css so that it would fit properly on their 
      respective webpage. <br><br>
      A majority of my Javascript is in the games that I have written. Currently, there are
      three games available to play being: Minesweeper, Snake, and Tic-Tac-Toe. When I began
      creating these I planned out a good poriton of my games using UML Diagrams so that I had
      a clear idea of what was required for the application to work. If you're interested
      in coding your own games in Javascript there are a multitude of online tutorials and
      guides that you can follow along with to make your own games! Not to mention, you can check
      out a link to my personal github in the <a href="https://plempke.github.io/contact.html">Contact Section</a>. 
        If you go on over to the repository for this website you'll see all the games source code in the
      commit folder. Furthermore, if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me personally 
      as I'm more than happy to lend a hand when it is needed! There wasn't much thought
      on how they would fit on my website when I first created them as so a lot of the formatting
      for the various game boards came after they had already been completed. <br>
      I elected to implement Google Firebase as my database so that I could record the high 
      scores of the games I have available. Currently, my website is able to keep track of
      all the high scores for <strong> Snake</strong>. Before you begin the game you simply
      input your intials and upon completion it will automatically update your highscore on the 
      table next to it. If you're interested in implementing Google Firebase in your own website
      check out this Youtube guide right<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrHT1iqSrAQ"> here!</a> 
      I found it to be extremely helpful when I started toying around with Firebase as it's simple, and easy to follow. 
      
      youtube videos to help me devlop my site. There are a lot of 
      great resources available for web development! Check em' out in the links provided!
